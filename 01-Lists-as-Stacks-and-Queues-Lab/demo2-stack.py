# A stack is a linear data structure that stores items
# The process of adding data to a stack is referred to as a "push"
# Retrieving data from a stack is called a "pop"
# Elements in a stack are added/removed from the top ("last in first, first out") or LIFO order
# The list methods make it very easy to use a list as a stack
# To add an item to the top of the stack, use append()
# To retrieve an item from the top of the stack, use pop()
