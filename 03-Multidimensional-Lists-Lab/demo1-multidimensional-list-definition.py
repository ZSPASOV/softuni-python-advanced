# There can be more than one additional dimension to lists
# Multi-dimensional lists are the lists within lists
# Examples:
# A grid is a basic example of two-dimensional list
# A cube is a basic example of three-dimensional list

# Usage:
# When dealing with graphics (pixels on the screen are in a grid formation)
# When working with tabular data
# Game development
# Other cases when you want each item of your list to be
# another list (Example: list of students, each of which has many tests)
