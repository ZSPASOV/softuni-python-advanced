# We should create 2 sub lists:

# an egg which fulfills the above requirements
# [7, 15, 12] => 15 is bigger than 7 and 12, and 12 is bigger than 7, so we return 15

# output [5]
# We should create 2 sublists ([-1, 2, 2], [0, 5, 3]) from
# the provided sequence and check whether each of them meets the given conditions.
# Since 2 is not bigger that 2 we donâ€™t include it in the final result and continue
# with the second sub list.

test = ([51, 21, 83, 52, 55], 1)

# output [83]

# 83 is bigger than 52 and 21 so we continue to check the second condition.
# 52 is bigger than 21 and 55 is bigger than 51, so we consider 83 as stronger egg.
